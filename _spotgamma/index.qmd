Spotgamma releases twitter "stream of thought" type of threads on a regular basis. Many of the notes are quite interesting and I plan on teasing out some of the more interesting bits here.

## 2024-01-21 - 2024-01-22
- On Jan 13th, SG released a thread on how 0DTE trading is increasing. The week of the 13th saw **the largest number of SPX call contracts ever bought**. (The OCC doesnt explicitly label 0dte, but as 0dte are the lowest priced contracts reflecting average premium, but record contracts).

- When looking at SPX contract volume as a percentage of total, the 0dte contracts represented 56% of SPX volume on 12/22, and everyday of the week in discussion being >= 49.7%.

- Monday the 8th had both their largest "SP500 0DTE HERO Signal" (teal) and largest "all expiry" HIRO (purple).

- Large 0DTE impact could be seen on Thursday the 11th, right after CPI was released. Assumed to believe the flow brough some mean reversion to the market after some weakness.

- On the 11th, volatility was subdued (mean reversion) right around the 12/noon (et) EU close. Starting off the SPX rejected off the 4800 call wall with heavy negative delats (purple & teal lines). Put buyers stopped (pink box) as the SPX hit "support" around ~4750. Here the downside move stalled out. Then with EU close SG's HIRO had a large positive surge (they purport it means puts were sold &|| calls were bought), which technically could be inferred with the HIRO lines moving materially higher (purple arrow).

**NOTE**: _HIRO_: Measures the "punch" (define?) of options flows, and large 0dte flows often correlate with SPX movement.
