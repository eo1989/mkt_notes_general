    "LU Factorization arises due to its computational efficiency, it mainly facilitates solving the system of linear equations, though the `flops` (number of floating point operations) of LU is still higher than the `Gaussian-Jordon` but it is still preferred due to its numerical stability and ease of implementation. Nonetheless, LU Factorization is particularly handy if you're computing multiple solutions of $Ax = b$, especially for different $b$ values. One example is, if you have a set $\\set{b_{1}{,} i\\thinspace ϵ\\thinspace 𝚭}$ such that\n",
